    <h1> egg </h1>
      <img src=eggs/egg.png width="256" height="256" border=7/> <br /> <br />
      The original Egg. It is a piece of simplicity, earning it the largest frame and a spot at the top of this museum.
    <h2> wide egg </h2>
      <img src=eggs/egg.png width="256" height="128" border=6/> <br /> <br />
      A widened Egg. No-one knows why it is so great in width, but not height. It persists nonetheless, in its thickened state.
    <h3> long egg </h3>
      <img src=eggs/egg.png width="128" height="256" border=5/> <br /> <br />
    A cousin of the wide Egg. People ask him if he plays basketball, but he cannot talk.
    <h4> spinning egg </h4>
      <img src=eggs/spin.gif width="128" height="128" border=4/> <br /> <br />
    A spinning Egg. Some say he has achieved perpetual motion, others applaud him for his lack of motion-sickness.
    <h5> upside down egg </h5>
      <img src=eggs/flip.png width="128" height="128" border=3/> <br /> <br />
    This Egg decided to do a hand? head? stand, and never came back down.

      <img src=eggs/invert.png width="96" height="96" border=2/> <br /> <br />
    This Egg turned off the power while the game was saving. He's never been the same ever since.
